# Heart-Bioreactor
Heart Bioreactor - IBBME
The Translation Biology and Engineering Program at The Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research requires a device which allows for the replication of hemodynamic forces on the aortic valves of mouse hearts. The goals are to understand the effect of these forces on the gene expression and phenotype of the valve cells, and how abnormal forces can lead to valve diseases. The team has been tasked to develop a bioreactor which will perform the function of simulating these forces in a whole mouse heart.
